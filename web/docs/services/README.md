# Services

Tide consists of the following services:

* The [API Server](./api-server/) provides the public JSON endpoints for the Tide service.
* The [Sync Server](./sync-server/) polls the WordPress.org APIâ€™s for themes and plugins to process and writes them to a queue.
* The [PHPCS Server](./phpcs-server/) reads messages from a queue and runs reports against both plugins and themes, then writes the results to the Firestore.
* The [Lighthouse Server](./lighthouse-server/) reads messages from a queue and runs Google Lighthouse reports against the themes only, then writes the results to the Firestore.

## Queues
